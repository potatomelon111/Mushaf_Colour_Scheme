# Mushaf_Colour_Scheme
A series of scripts to generate a Mushaf in the Uthmani script, in custom colours. The intent of this is too potentially add an aestheic drive to read more Quran (as opposed to being decoration. Hence, after using this script, it's vital that you utilise your Mushaf for the intended purpose - i.e. reading from it)
