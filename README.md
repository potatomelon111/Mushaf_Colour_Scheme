# Mushaf_Colour_Scheme
A series of scripts to generate a Mushaf in the Uthmani script, in custom colours. The intent of this is too potentially add an aestheic drive to read more Quran (as opposed to being decoration. Hence, after using this script, it's vital that you utilise your Mushaf for the intended purpose - i.e. reading from it)

The SVG files are converted from the original Adobe Illustrator files provided by the King Fahd Complex for the Printing of the Holy Quran. This is the 1441 edition.
